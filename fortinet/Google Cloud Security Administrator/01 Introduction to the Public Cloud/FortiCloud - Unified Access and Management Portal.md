FortiCloud is a centralized login portal that serves as a unified authentication mechanism for accessing and managing your entire Fortinet portfolio of products and services.

Through FortiCloud, you can:

- View, manage, and access all your Fortinet products and services in one convenient location.
- Access various services, including FortiMail, FortiGate CNF, FortiDevSec, FortiFlex, and FortiWeb Cloud.
- Use the Identity and Access Management (IAM) portal to create users with specific permissions to different Fortinet portals (e.g., granting one administrator access only to FortiWeb Cloud and another only to FortiMail).
