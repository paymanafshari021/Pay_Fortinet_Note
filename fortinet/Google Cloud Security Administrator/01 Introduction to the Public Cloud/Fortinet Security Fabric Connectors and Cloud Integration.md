Fabric Connectors are a key part of Fortinet's Security Fabric architecture designed to address the complexities of modern digital enterprises and reduce security gaps.

They function by:

- **Extending Visibility and Management:** Fabric connectors broaden the security posture by linking Fortinet's Security Fabric into partner infrastructure and applications through API integration points or specialized engineering.
- **Centralized Orchestration:** They help maintain a consistent network security posture with centralized orchestration across hybrid, public, and private cloud environments, covering users, applications, and data.
- **Enabling Automation:** They allow for the automation of workflows, threat feeds, and security policy automation across clouds as new services and applications are deployed, reducing manual intervention. For Google Cloud specifically, Fortinet can pull information like addresses, VM names, and subnets to create firewall policies.

Fortinet makes these connectors instantly accessible to customers via downloadable DevOps kits with one-click activation.
