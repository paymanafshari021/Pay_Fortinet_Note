The FortiFlex Calculator is a tool used to estimate the points consumption associated with a given Fortinet cloud configuration, as the FortiFlex model charges users based on resource use.

Using the calculator, you can select and define:

- The product type
- The number of Virtual Machines (VMs)
- The CPU size
- The service bundle (e.g., FortiGuard)
- The number of virtual domains

The points consumption—which is based on the VM, CPU size, service bundle, and cloud services—updates dynamically and immediately with any changes you make. The calculation determines the daily charge based on the largest configuration points of any VM and associated services deployed on that day.

Once configured, you can add the selections to a Bill of Materials (BOM).
