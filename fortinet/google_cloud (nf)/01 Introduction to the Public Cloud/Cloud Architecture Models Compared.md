The choice of cloud architecture depends on factors like cost, required security isolation, and hardware ownership. There are three main models discussed: Public, Private, and Hybrid.

Here is a comparison of these models:

|Feature|Public Cloud|Private Cloud|Hybrid Cloud|
|:--|:--|:--|:--|
|**Owner**|Cloud provider|Organization|Mixed|
|**Cost**|Lower (based on use)|Higher|Highest/Mixed|
|**Hardware**|Shared|Dedicated|Mixed|
|**Connectivity**|Through the internet|Through a private network|Mixed|
|**End Users**|Multiple|Within organization|Mixed|

### Architectural Details

- **Public Cloud:** These clouds are available to any organization and are offered by large vendors like Amazon, Microsoft, and Google.
- **Private Cloud:** This model is designed to be visible only to the organization that created it. It provides the benefits of cloud computing while allowing the organization to maintain ownership of data and equipment, typically running virtual environments on internal server stacks.
- **Hybrid Cloud:** This infrastructure combines two or more distinct cloud infrastructures (public, private, or community) that remain unique entities but are bound together by technology that enables data and application portability (e.g., cloud bursting).
