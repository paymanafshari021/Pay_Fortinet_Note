Fortinet offers several licensing models for Google Cloud deployment, allowing customers flexibility based on their usage requirements:

1. **FortiFlex (FlexVM):** This is a usage-based licensing model, similar to Pay-As-You-Go, but charges are calculated daily based on a predefined points system. It is managed through FortiCloud. FortiFlex is highly flexible, allowing customers to change VM specifications (like RAM or CPU) on the fly without needing to purchase a new license. It is offered in Prepaid (for enterprises) and Postpaid (for MSSPs) programs.
2. **Bring Your Own License (BYOL):** The customer purchases the Fortinet license separately and pays the cloud vendor directly for the underlying Virtual Machines (VMs) running 24/7. This model is recommended for VMs that are always running and typically includes Fortinet 24/7 support.
3. **Pay As You Go (PAYG) or On Demand:** The customer pays the cloud vendor for both the service and the infrastructure based on hourly or yearly usage. This model typically provides Fortinet 8x5 support.

Note that switching between BYOL and PAYG requires redeployment of the VM.
