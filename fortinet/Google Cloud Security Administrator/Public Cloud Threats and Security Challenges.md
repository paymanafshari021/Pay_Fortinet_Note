The concept of "Threats to and Challenges of the Public Cloud" refers to the specific security and operational difficulties organizations face when migrating to or using cloud environments.

### Threats to the Public Cloud

According to the 2023 Cloud Security Report sponsored by Fortinet, several key threats endanger public cloud environments:

- **Cloud Misconfigurations:** More than 51% of surveyed cybersecurity professionals consider **misconfigurations of the public cloud as the number one threat**.
- **Malware:** Defending against malware remains a significant concern.
- **Insecure Interfaces/APIs:** Vulnerabilities in the interfaces and APIs used to interact with cloud services are commonly reported threats.
- **Exfiltration of Sensitive Data:** The unauthorized transfer of sensitive data outside the cloud environment is a recognized threat.
- **Unauthorized Access**.

### Challenges of the Public Cloud

The primary challenges when operating in the public cloud relate mostly to governance, architecture, and regulatory requirements:

1. **Who Is Responsible for Security? (Shared Responsibility):** Security responsibility is arguably the top challenge.
    
    - The cloud security model operates under a **shared responsibility** structure.
    - The **cloud provider secures the infrastructure** (storage, network, compute), which is considered the "lower stack".
    - The **customer is responsible for securing the "upper stack,"** including applications, data, the operating system (OS), firewalls, network settings, and configurations.
    - A significant concern is that **Gartner estimates 99% of cloud security failures will be the customer's fault through 2025**. Essentially, if you manage it (even virtual resources), you are responsible for its security.
2. **Determining Cloud Architecture:** Deciding which cloud architecture should be implemented is a significant challenge. This involves choosing between public, private, or **hybrid cloud** models.
    
3. **Reaching Regulatory Compliance:** Achieving and maintaining compliance with various data and industry regulations is listed as one of the major challenges.
