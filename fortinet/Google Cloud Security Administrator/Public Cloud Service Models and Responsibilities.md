The phrase "No Single Concept of the Public Cloud" explains that the term "public cloud," which originated in the marketing world, actually refers to **one or more specific concepts in the technology world** 1\.  
This diversity is most clearly seen in the various service models offered through the public cloud 2:

1. **Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS):** In this model, some elements like networking and services are managed by the vendor, while others are managed by the customer 2\. Examples include the Virtual Machines (VMs) deployed during labs and Google Cloud's Compute Engine 2, 3\.  
2. **Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS):** In a PaaS solution, the vendor manages most of the services, and the customer is responsible only for programming the applications 4\. Google Cloud's App Engine is an example of PaaS 3\.  
3. **Software-as-a-Service (SaaS):** With SaaS, the customer simply uses the services as a consumer to run applications 4\. Examples include Dropbox, Office365, and Salesforce 4\.

These different models demonstrate that the public cloud is not a single concept but rather a set of varied offerings, each defining a different level of responsibility shared between the cloud vendor and the client 1, 2\. In contrast, a traditional on-premises scenario means that all resources, such as servers, switches, and databases, run locally on site 2\.  
The division of responsibilities for security illustrates how different the concepts are:

* In a basic public cloud model, the **cloud provider secures the infrastructure** (storage, network, compute), while the **customer is responsible for securing the upper stack** (applications, data, OS, firewall and network settings) 5, 6\.  
* In the specialized SaaS model, for instance, a customer uses the service as a consumer, and third-party security solutions might only be able to provide "visibility and control" but not secure connectivity like an IPsec tunnel or Web Application Firewall (WAF) (e.g., to Dropbox) 4, 7\.

Effectively, the concept of the "public cloud" operates like a menu with various service options (IaaS, PaaS, SaaS), each defining a distinct level of infrastructure ownership and management responsibilities, rather than a single, uniform product.
