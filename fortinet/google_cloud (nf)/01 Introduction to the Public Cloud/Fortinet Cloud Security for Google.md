Securing Google Cloud involves applying security measures across several key customer initiatives and utilizing Fortinet solutions categorized into three main pillars:

### Customer Initiatives that Require Security

Securing Google Cloud generally means providing protection for core customer activities, including:

- Migrating or extending applications to the cloud.
- Data center transformation to the cloud.
- Consuming Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) applications.
- Building cloud-native applications.

### Fortinet's Solutions

Fortinet offers broad protection and centralized management across the entire digital attack surface (both on-premises and in public clouds) using three key solutions for Google Cloud:

1. **Visibility and Control:** This solution provides unified visibility and control, along with policy management. Fortinet can only provide visibility and control for SaaS applications, such as Dropbox, because you cannot create secure connectivity like an IPsec tunnel or Web Application Firewall (WAF) to a SaaS application.
2. **Application Security:** This focuses on securing the applications themselves.
3. **Secure Connectivity:** This is Fortinet's solution for establishing secure network connections. This is typically provided for Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS) deployments, where you can create secure tunnels.

Fortinet aims to provide consistent security across platforms through **native integration** with major cloud providers, which enables the ability to natively consume cloud services and extend web service-based APIs.
