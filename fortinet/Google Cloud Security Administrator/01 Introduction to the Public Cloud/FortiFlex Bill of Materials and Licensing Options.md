The FortiFlex Bill of Materials (BOM) page is generated after you configure a service selection using the FortiFlex Calculator.

On the BOM page, you can:

- Select the term (in years) for how long the services are required, which dynamically updates the total points needed.
- View the configuration's total points consumption.
- See the suggested Prepaid SKUs and quantities.
- Export the configuration as an Excel spreadsheet using the Export BOM button.
