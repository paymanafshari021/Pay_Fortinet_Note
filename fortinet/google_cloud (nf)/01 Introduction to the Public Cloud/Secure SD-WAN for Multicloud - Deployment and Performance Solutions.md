The primary challenge with current multicloud deployments is that many organizations attempt to connect their different cloud networks back through their on-premises data center WAN edge for centralized inspection and routing.

This traditional WAN approach, although secure, leads to several issues:

- **Deployment Complexity:** Managing security across multiple, diverse cloud platforms and environments is difficult, especially given the lack of skilled IT and cybersecurity talent.
- **Performance Degradation:** Connecting clouds through the data center WAN edge inhibits agility and results in inconsistent application performance.
- **High Costs:** Connectivity often depends on expensive leased lines, MPLS connections, or IPsec VPNs.

To overcome these challenges, solutions like Fortinet Secure SD-WAN for Multicloud offer a way to establish secure, high-performance connectivity directly between IaaS workloads running on different clouds.

The Fortinet Secure SD-WAN for Multicloud solution offers a new approach for securely connecting Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS) workloads across different cloud platforms, specifically addressing the issues of traditional multicloud networking.

This solution provides high-performance connectivity directly between clouds without routing traffic back through an on-premises data center WAN edge, which typically causes deployment complexity, performance degradation, and high costs associated with leased lines.

Key capabilities of the Fortinet Secure SD-WAN solution include:

- **Automated Overlay Network:** It automates the deployment of a seamless overlay network across diverse cloud networks, saving time and resources.
- **Centralized Management:** It offers centralized orchestration, control, and visibility through Fortinet Security Fabric software-defined networking (SDN) connectors and native cloud integrations.
- **Secure, Direct Transport:** It securely transports cloud traffic between clouds directly, enabling better scaling and reduced latency.
- **Intelligent Connection Selection:** It intelligently selects connections based on application and workload awareness, which improves performance and reduces reliance on expensive MPLS or leased line connections.
