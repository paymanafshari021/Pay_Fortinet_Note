The other primary Fortinet licensing models for cloud deployments, besides FortiFlex, are Bring Your Own License (BYOL) and Pay As You Go (PAYG) or On Demand.

Here is a breakdown of these models:

1. **Bring Your Own License (BYOL):**
    
    - The customer purchases the Fortinet license separately (acquired through partners).
    - The customer pays the cloud vendor directly for the underlying Virtual Machines (VMs) and infrastructure running costs.
    - This model is typically recommended for VMs that are running all the time and usually includes Fortinet 24/7 support with the enterprise bundle.
2. **Pay As You Go (PAYG) or On Demand:**
    
    - The customer pays for both the service and the infrastructure through the cloud vendor.
    - The payment is based on hourly or yearly usage and depends on the instance type.
    - Customers typically receive Fortinet 8x5 support with the Unified Threat Management (UTM) bundle in this model.

For both BYOL and PAYG, the customer is responsible for paying the infrastructure running costs directly to the cloud vendor. Note that switching between the BYOL and PAYG models requires the redeployment of the VM or instances.
