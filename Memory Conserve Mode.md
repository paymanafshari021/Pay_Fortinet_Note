FortiGate's conserve mode is ==a self-protection mechanism that activates when system memory usage exceeds a configurable threshold (default 88%) to prevent a system crash==. This mode impacts performance by reducing functionality, and at a more critical threshold (default 95%), it will drop new sessions to free up memory. The device exits conserve mode once memory usage drops below another threshold (default 82%)
