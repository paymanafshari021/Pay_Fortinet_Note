# Border Gateway Protocol (BGP)
## BGP Overview
- Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) is a standardized **Exterior Gateway Protocol (EGP)**. 
- Differs from interior protocols like **RIP, OSPF, and EIGRP**, which are **Interior Gateway Protocols (IGPs)**.
- **BGPv4** is the current version in widespread use.
### Purpose and Function
- Designed for routing **between Autonomous Systems (ASes)**, not within them.
- Operates as a **Path Vector protocol**, using:
    - **AS Path length** as a primary factor.
    - Additional BGP **attributes** instead of traditional IGP metrics (e.g., distance or cost).
- Forms the backbone routing protocol of the **Internet**, which consists of interconnected ASes.
### Autonomous System Numbers (ASNs)
- ASN is a **16-bit identifier**, ranging from **1–65535**.
- **64512–65535** are reserved for **private/internal use**.
### Transport
- BGP uses **TCP port 179** to reliably exchange routing information.

## BGP Components
### BGP Speaker or Peer
 - A router that both sends or receives Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) routing information.
### BGP Session
- The communication link established between two BGP peers for exchanging routing data.

## AS Types
### **Stub AS**
- An AS that only handles **local traffic** and has **a single connection** to another AS.
- **Characteristics:**
    - Only one exit point to the Internet or another AS.
    - Routes traffic that originates and terminates **within the AS**.
### **Multihomed AS**
- An AS that handles **local traffic only**, but has **multiple connections** to different ASes.
- **Characteristics:**
    - Multiple exit points for redundancy or load balancing.
    - Still does not provide transit for other ASes.
### **Transit AS**
- An AS that handles **local traffic** and also **transit traffic** (traffic passing through to other ASes).
- **Characteristics:**
    - Provides connectivity between other ASes.
    - Can originate, terminate, and forward traffic.

## Split Horizon

- **iBGP Split-Horizon Rule:** iBGP routers do **not** advertise routes learned from one iBGP peer to another.
- **Prevents routing loops** within the autonomous system (AS).
- To ensure all routers learn all prefixes inside the AS, a **full iBGP mesh** must be created among all iBGP routers.
