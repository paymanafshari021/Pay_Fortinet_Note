The Fortinet Cloud Security Solution enhances protection in cloud environments and extends security services across various deployments.

Key benefits of this solution include:

- **Extended Protection:** It extends to physical, virtual, and cloud devices with unified threat protection and advanced security orchestration.
- **Enhanced Control and Visibility:** It provides greater control and visibility by allowing security policies to be set based on user applications, device specifications, IP addresses, and network interfaces.
- **Optimized Security:** It delivers a highly optimized solution that protects application workloads _beyond_ native cloud vendor security options. It is important to remember that this solution is an extra security layer, not a replacement for the cloud vendor's existing security.
