The "Born in the Cloud" concept describes an environment where customers run all necessary IT equipment and security devices entirely within the public cloud, eliminating the need for physical, on-premises equipment.

Key aspects of this approach include:

- **No Physical Equipment:** There is no need to run physical devices on-premises, as all devices, such as FortiGate, FortiAnalyzer, and FortiWeb, can be offered in cloud-based form.
- **Cost Benefits:** Customers benefit from hourly billing.
- **Full Security:** This model provides full enterprise-class security, ensuring compliance and policy enforcement.
- **Deployment:** A typical deployment involves a single FortiGate Virtual Machine (VM) running on Google Cloud Compute Engine.

The Born in the Cloud model provides a highly optimized solution that extends protection beyond native cloud vendor security options, although it is important to remember that the Fortinet solution is an extra layer of security, not a replacement for existing cloud vendor security.
